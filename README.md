# Hospital Emergency Room Dashboard


## Project Overview
This project involves designing an interactive and insightful Power BI dashboard to analyze and visualize data from a hospital's emergency room. The dataset covers patient statistics over a period of 19 months, providing valuable insights into patient demographics, satisfaction, and operational metrics.

## Key Features
1. Interactive Visualizations:

- Monthly View: Displays the number of patients, average wait time, satisfaction scores, and department referrals for each month.
- Consolidated View: Provides a high-level summary of overall trends and patterns.
- Patient Details: Explores detailed patient data, including age group, gender, and admission status.
- Key Takeaways: Summarizes key insights from the analysis.

2. KPIs and Metrics:

- Average Wait Time: 36.3 minutes (indicating room for improvement).
- Satisfaction Score: 4.96 out of 5 (shows positive feedback).
- Department Referrals: Highlights the most referred departments (e.g., General Practice, Orthopedics).

3. Demographic and Behavioral Insights:

- Patient demographics segmented by age, gender, and race.
- Analysis of peak busy hours and days for resource optimization.
  
4. Custom Visualizations:

- Heatmaps to display patient counts by hour and day.
- Bar and donut charts for demographic breakdowns.
- Line graphs to track monthly trends.

## Technologies Used
- Power BI Desktop: For data modeling, visualization, and report creation.
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): Used to calculate KPIs and dynamic measures.
- Custom Date Table: For time intelligence and filtering.

## Key Insights
- The busiest days were Mondays, and peak hours were 11 AM, 7 PM, and 11 PM, indicating a need for better staffing during these periods.
- The average wait time (36.3 minutes) suggests moderate patient satisfaction and areas for process optimization.
- Adults aged 30-39 years and young adults aged 20-29 years were the most frequent visitors, indicating a higher prevalence of cases in these age groups.

## Future Enhancements
- Integrating real-time data for live monitoring.
- Adding predictive analytics for emergency room resource allocation.
- Creating additional pages for financial and operational analysis.

##  Summary

The dataset reveals high patient volumes, moderate satisfaction levels, and common referrals to General Practice and Orthopedics. Mondays and late night to early mornings hours are particularly busy The patient demographics show a diverse age and racial composition, with nearly equal numbers of admitted and non admitted patients. These insights can help optimize resource allocation and improve patient care in the emergency room.
